## Divinator
This app uses Python and the Tkinter module to generate 'divinations' using tarot cards, dice, a magic 8-ball, etc. It does so with microservices communicating through ZMQ.

The image_service microservice was created by Mohammed Al Dehaimi for use in this project.

All tarot card images are in the public domain. All die images were taken by me.
